# bts-lyrics
BTS Lyrics generator - which generates lyrics from the model trained on all BTS songs. I refered to a project on kaggle which used a Bi-directional LSTM and I fine-tuned the hyperparameters. The model achieved an accuracy of ~83%. As it takes around 9-10 hours to train the model, I have used pickle to store the trained model.
To generate lyrics, run the file - get_output.py
I have also tried to use Andrej Garpathy's simple transformer code to train a transformer on this dataset. I used tiktoken library by OpenAI to tokenize the lyrics before feeding it to the model. The model achieved a validation loss of   when trained on 500 steps. 
The lyrics generated by the transformer are as follows:
